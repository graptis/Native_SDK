:Title:
GnomeHorde

:ShortDescription:
This demo shows a very efficient technique for multithreaded command buffer generation and rendering.

:FullDescription:
The GnomeHorde divides its world into tiles, each containing a small number of objects.
It uses 3 groups of threads - the Main thread, which kicks all other tasks and does the
actual command buffer submisison (rendering), a number of Visibility threads, each of 
which processes large groups of tiles, and a number of Tile Processing threads, each of
which generate command buffers for a tile. Command buffers are created (when the tile has
just become visible), recalculated (when the tile's Level Of Detail has changed) or 
recycled (when the tile has just become nonvisible) as required.
The communication of the threads is abstracted using Producer-Consumer Queues passing the
coordinates of tiles as parameters.
When all generation is done, the main thread collects all secondary command buffers and
submits them to the GPU rendering Queue.
