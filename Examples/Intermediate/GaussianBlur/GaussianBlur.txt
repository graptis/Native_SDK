:Title:
GaussianBlur

:ShortDescription:
Shows how to perform a extremely wide, highly optimized Gaussian Blur using Compute shaders.

:FullDescription:
This training course demonstrates how to perform a 19x19 Gaussian Blur leveraging every input and output step
to blur an image by reading from an input using compute while blurring in one direction, and then writing to 
the output with a Fragment shader while blurring in the other direction.
This technique used has been highly optimized for PowerVR and is highly suitable for very large convolution width.
