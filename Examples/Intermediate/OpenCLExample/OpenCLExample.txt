:Title:
OpenCLExample

:ShortDescription:
This training course demonstrates using small image convolution OpenCL kernels.

:FullDescription:
This training course shows how to structure an application with OpenCL / OpenGL interoperability or, if necessary, CPU fallback for it, to process images on the GPU using OpenCL. Several 3x3 convolution filters are shown (Gaussian Blur, erode/dilate, edge detection, emboss).

:APIS:
OpenGL ES 2.0+ with OpenCL

:Controls:
	-	Left/Right	-	Change the convolution filter
	-	Quit	-	Close the application
