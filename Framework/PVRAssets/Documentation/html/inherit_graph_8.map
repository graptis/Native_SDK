An effect is intended to describe an entire, possibly multipass, rendering configuration, for several different objects &#45; potentially an entire scene &#45; by defining all the targets, textures, buffers, different pipelines for different objects, as long as they fulfil some similar conceptual roles (see subpass groups). By using &quot;SEMANTICS&quot;, i.e. descriptions of different items of information that may be provided from outside (e.g. the model, the animation system, or other), it provides a clear interface for the application to provide this information and render automatically. For an implementation of a rendering system using that, see the RenderManager in Vulkan Utilities. " alt="" coords="111,5,239,46"/>
<area shape="rect" id="node3" href="$classpvr_1_1assets_1_1_model.html" title="The Model class represents an entire Scene, or Model. It is mainly a Node structure, allowing various different kinds of data to be stored in the Nodes. The class contains a tree&#45;like structure of Nodes. Each Node can be a Mesh node (containing a Mesh), Camera node or Light node. The tree&#45;structure assumes transformational hierarchy (as usual). Transformations are expressed through Animation objects (a static transform is an animation with a single frame) There is an implicit order in the nodes &#45; First in the array the Mesh nodes will be laid out, then Camera and Light nodes." alt="" coords="109,71,240,97"/>
