<h1>The PowerVR SDK</h1>

The PowerVR SDK is an open source codebase that can help you develop Graphics applications for PowerVR and other platforms.
It consists of two main parts: the examples and the framework.

The framework is a collection of libraries that aim to ease development of OpenGL and Vulkan real-time applications
by removing the boilerplate code and in general enhancing productivity. The Framework can be thought of as the
lowest-level parts of a graphics engine - the main loop, platform abstraction and graphical utilities. There are some
experimental examples of how someone could build an actual engine on top of it.
Basically, the framework is there to make the uninteresting bits smaller (or even make them disappear), while focusing on the Graphics API calls
to draw something on the screen, with as little boilerplate as possible.

The examples themselves are mostly code samples intended to:

<ul>
<li>Show the basics of OpenGL and Vulkan (e.g. HelloAPI, IntroducingPVRShell)</li>
<li>Demonstrate optimal implementations for techniques relevant for PowerVR (e.g. our DeferredShading with Pixel Local 
  Storage/transient attachments, our GaussianBlur special implementation)</li>
<li>Demonstrate how to use important extensions that may optimise your code (e.g. IMGFrameBufferDownsample, 
  IMGTextureFilterCubic)</li>
</ul>
</br>
The examples are built on top of the framework in such a way so that only the relevant code is left.

Developers can join the PowerVR Insider programme and interact with our
online Community at <a href="http://www.powervrinsider.com">www.powervrinsider.com</a>. Also visit
our <a href="Contact.html">Contact</a> page for further details on how to get

this release of the PowerVR Tools and SDK. please visit
<a href="https://community.imgtec.com/download-notes/">Release Notes</a>.

<h2>Platform Setup</h2>

<h3>Android</h3>

<ul>
<li>Install the Android SDK.</li>
<li>Through the Android SDK Manager (either through Android Studio or command line SDK manager), install the following packages (and any other packages with features you may require)
	<ul>
		<li>The Android NDK bundle</li>
		<li>The Android 26 platform (that is the build version we are using)</li>
		<li>Suitable platform-tools (at the current release we are using 26.0.2 but many others are suitable. Prefer the latest versions.)</li>
		<li>CMake</li>
		<li>(Optional, if using Android Studio) LLDB (for on-device debugging)</li>
	</ul>
If you are using Android Studio, it will prompt you for any missing packages when attempting to build.
</li>
<li>The gradle build scripts can be found in the <span class="code">[path-to-sdk]/build-android</span> folder, and in each example's corresponding <span class="code">build-android</span> folder. 
<ul>
	<li>To build from Android Studio, use the <span class="code">Import project</span> dialog select the corresponding <span class="code">build-android</span> the first time you open a solution.</li>
	<li>To build from the command line, navigate to the build-android folder and run <span class="code">gradlew assemble[Debug/Release]</span></li>
</ul>
<li><strong>For detailed build instructions, see <a href="../../BUILD.rst">BUILD.rst</a></strong></li>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>iOS</h3>
<ul>
<li>Download a version of Apple's iOS SDK from <a href="http://developer.apple.com/ios/">http://developer.apple.com/ios/</a>.</li>
<li>You may need to become a member of Apple's developer programme. You can find details of how to join at <a href="http://developer.apple.com/">http://developer.apple.com/</a>.</li>
<li>Install the Apple SDK on your Mac as specified by Apple's instructions. This will include Xcode and any other development tools required.</li>
<li>To build for an iOS device you will need a valid Apple develeloper certificate in your machine's keychain. You may also have to change the <span class="code">Properties | Identifier</span> property from <span class="code">Project | Edit Active Target...</span> to match that which you have set up for yourself through Apple's Program Portal.</li>
<li>If you do not have a developer certificate from Apple then you can still build and launch applications in the iOS Simulator (Choose this configuration from the dropdown menu at the top left).</li>
<li>Extract the PowerVR SDK to a location of your choosing</li>
<li>Install CMake</li>
<li>Run CMake and use the corresponding projects (see the detailed build instructions)</li>
<li> <strong>Note:</strong> The Scheme that you are building under may need to be set up for the SDK's projects to run.</li>
<li><strong>For detailed build instructions, see <a href="../../BUILD.rst">BUILD.rst</a></strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>Windows</h3>

<strong>Note:</strong> PVRVFrame PC Emulation is not intended to be a completely accurate replication of the behaviour of PowerVR hardware. This tool is
a wrapper around desktop OpenGL so its performance and capabilities will depend on the 3D acceleration present in your system.

<ul>
<li>Install the PowerVR SDK on your machine at a location of your choosing.</li>
<li>If you have installed our SDK with the installer, the PVRVFrame emulation libraries will already be in your PATH environment variable.</li>
<li>Otherwise, manually add the PVRVframe libraries to your path. Depending on the type of package you got, they may be pre-installed in the <span class="code">[path-to-sdk]/libs</span? folder</li>
<li>Run CMake to generate your project files and run the corresponding projects.</li>
<li><strong>For detailed build instructions, see <a href="../../BUILD.rst">BUILD.rst</a></strong></li>
</ul>

<strong>Note:</strong> If the installer has not added the PVRVFrame directory to your PATH environment variable, you must copy the PVRVFrame emulation
libraries to a DLL-accessible directory prior to running the SDK applications. This may be anywhere in the path, next to the executable, or in the windows default folders.
If you wish to install system-wide and run both 32 and 64 bit builds using the PVRVFrame libraries, you can copy the 64-bit version in %windir%\System32 and the 32-bit version in %windir%\SysWOW64
so that they are automatically selected by the corresponding applications. Otherwise, you may need to manually modify your path based on which architecture you need to run (i.e. if the 32-bit
libraries are in the path 64 bit applications cannot be run and vice versa).
The driver files names are; libEGL.dll, libGLES\_CM.dll (OpenGL ES 1.x) and libGLESv2.dll (OpenGL ES 2.0 & 3.x).

<h3>Linux</h3>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> API libraries are not distributed with the PowerVR Graphics
SDK for Linux. Please ask your platform provider for these libraries if
you do not have them. You will also need to install the latest platform
toolchain on your development machine for your target platform.</p>

<p>To build:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Ensure you have the corresponding libraries to build.</li>
	<li>For example, you may need X11 packages, Wayland packages, libc++ and other libraries depending on the build configuration.</li>
	<li>For on-device compiling, it is enough to usually run CMake.</li>
	<li>For cross-compilation, you can use a CMake toolchain we provide in [path-to-sdk]/cmake/toolchains. We support any of the following architectures:
	<ul>
		<li>armv7</li>
		<li>armv7hf</li>
		<li>armv8</li>
		<li>mips_32</li>
		<li>mips_64</li>
		<li>x86_32</li>
		<li>x86_64</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Rember to pass the windowing system in the CMake command line: <span class="code">-DWS=[X11, Wayland, NullWS...]</span></li>
	<li>Run <span class="code">cmake [path-to-sdk or path-to-example] [WS=...] [TOOLCHAIN=...]</span></li>
</ul>
<p>To run an executable on a Development machine (desktop):</p>
<ul>
	<li>X11 and Wayland binaries should be run from within the corresponding windowing system.</li>
	<li>Run the binary as normal</li>
</ul>
<p>To run an executable on a PowerVR Device:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Ensure that the PowerVR drivers are installed on the target device (please refer to the DDK/driver installation instructions).</li>
	<li>Ensure any libraries you are using are installed in your target device (libc, libc++, libdl etc).</li>
	<li>Ensure the drivers are running (e.g., type /etc/init.d/rc/pvr start</li>
	<li>Run an X session if required).</li>
	<li>Run the binary. Several options can be passed, pass the -help parameter to show command line options.
		(for example,  X11 window sizes can be specified for the executables using the command-line arguments -posx=n 
		and -posy=n to define the top right hand corner, and -width=n and -height=n to define width and height, respectively.)</li>
	<li>If you attempt to run an SDK example and it fails with the message: "Can't open display" produced by the X client, then make sure that
		the DISPLAY variable is set with the shell command: "set \| grep -e DISPLAY". If this command does not yield any output then type (in
		shell): "DISPLAY=:0.0; export DISPLAY"</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<br/>

<h1>Build Instructions</h1>

<p>All the projects in this SDK are based on <a href="https://cmake.org/">CMake</a>, an open-source, cross-platform tool designed to create project files for a variety of Compilers and IDEs.
Please download CMake from <a href="https://cmake.org/download/">the CMake website</a> and install it to be able to create the projects to build our SDK.</p>
<p>Android builds use the same CMake files, integrated in the Android gradle-based build system. In order to build for Android, follow the specific instructions for Android; you should not run CMake manually.
Also, you do not need to download CMake to build for Android, as it is bundled in the Android SDK. See the <a href="#ANDROID_INSTRUCTIONS">Android Instructions</a></p>
<p>Each example in the SDK contains its own CMake file, a few supporting files in a folder called <span class="code">cmake-resources</span> (these are files needed to generate CMake projects for some platforms) and Android build scripts in a <span class="code">android-build</span> folder. These will build that example, including all (framework and external) dependencies. There is also a global CMake file and <span class="code">android-build</span> at the root of the SDK, which 
will build all the Examples and Framework projects in one go.</p>

<h2>CMake instructions</h2>

<p>For building on Android, you should not call CMake manually as the Android build system calls that at the correct time. See the `Android instructions`_.</p>

<p>Create and navigate to a directory where to put all the generated files, and execute CMake pointing it to the directory where the CMakeLists.txt is,
e.g. from <span class="code">[path-to-sdk]/cmake-build/</span>, or from <span class="code">[path-to-sdk]/examples/[example_api]/[example_name]/</span></p>

<ul><li><span class="code">[path-to-sdk]/cmake-build>cmake .. (optionally -G"[Unix Makefiles, Visual Studio 15, Xcode, eclipse etc])</span></li></ul>

<h3>Building the generated project</h3>

<p>The projects can be built "as usual" based on the types of projects you have selected (through Visual Studio, calling <span class="code">make</span> for the makefiles etc.)</p>

<p>Binaries are output in the <span class="code">bin</span> subfolder of your cmake build folder or android-build folder.</p>

<h4>Unix Makefiles</h4>

<p>Unix makefiles are the default way to build on on Linux, but also work anywhere where a make program exists.</p>

<p>Unix Makefiles can also be used on macOS and potentially other platforms that support a <span class="code">make</span> command.</p>

<p>Building the project is done by calling <span class="code">make [-j8 , other options]</span></p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> We recommend to always pass the -j[some number] parameter with a number close to the number of CPU cores to your system when building with Makefiles - it speeds the build up *dramatically*. We have found -j8 to be safe and suitable for a lot of systems.</p>

<h4>Windows Visual Studio</h4>
<p>Microsoft Visual Studio is default generator on Windows. CMake cannot generate multi-architecture projects (ones that support both 32-bit and 64-bit) as is conventional on most familiar with MSVC, so you need to select one. We recommend 64 bit if available, but both are fully supported. The default CMake architecture is 32-bit, you can set it to 64-bit by passing the -A[x64] parameter.</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="code">cmake [path-to-CMakeLists.txt]</span> //Generates a solution for the installed version of Visual Studio, 32-bit</li>
<li><span class="code">cmake [path-to-CMakeLists.txt] -Ax64</span> //Generates a solution for the installed version of Visual Studio, 64-bit</li>
<li><span class="code">cmake [path-to-CMakeLists.txt] -G "Visual Studio 15" -Ax64</span> //Generates Visual Studio 2017 solution, 64-bit</li>
<li>... etc</li>
</ul>

<h4>Xcode (when targetting macOS)</h4>

<p>In order to generate Xcode projects, the Xcode generator must be explicitly passed:</p>

<p><span class="code">cmake [path-to-CMakeLists.txt] -G Xcode</span></p>

</p>Then, you can open the generate project files with Xcode as normal, or build from command line with <span class="code">xcodebuild</span> or <span class="code">cmake --build .</span></p>

<h4>Xcode (when targeting iOS)</h4>
<p>The instructions for iOS are same as macOS but, additionally, a CMake Toolchain file needs to be passed (as iOS is cross-compiled). We provide it in <span class="code">[path-to-sdk]/cmake/toolchains/Darwin-gcc-ios</span></p>

<p>Generate the Xcode projects with:</p>

<p><span class="code">cmake [path-to-CMakeLists.txt] -G Xcode -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=[path-to-sdk]/cmake/toolchains/Darwin-gcc-ios.cmake</span></p>

<h3>CMake supported Parameters</h3>

<p>You can pass parameters to CMake using the -D[PARAM_NAME]=[PARAM_VALUE] syntax. There are a lot of built-in parameters that can be passed to control aspects of the build (see the CMake documentation for more information on advanced usage). Additionally there are a few PowerVR SDK specific parameters we define. The most important ones are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE</strong> : The build variant. Supported values: Debug, <strong>Release (Default)</strong>, MinSizeRel, RelWithDebInfo</li>
<li><strong>-DBUILD_OPENGLES_EXAMPLES</strong> (Optional): Pass this parameters if you have downloaded both Vulkan and OpenGL examples but, for whatever reason, you want to create a solution only for the OpenGL ES ones</li>
<li><strong>-DBUILD_VULKAN_EXAMPLES</strong> (Optional): Pass this parameters if you have downloaded both Vulkan and OpenGL examples but, for whatever reason, you want to create a solution only for the OpenGL ES ones</li>
<li><strong>-DWS=</strong>[<strong>NullWS(Default)</strong>, X11, Wayland, Screen] : <strong>(Linux and QNX Only)</strong>. Controls the Windowing System. Usually, desktop linux systems will be running an X11/XCB or Wayland server. Development platform very commonly use a NullWS system (the GPU renders to the screen directly without a windowing system). Screen is commonly used on QNX. Usually, you need -DWS=X11 or -DWS=Wayland for typical desktop PCs running Linux, and -DWS=X11, -DWS=Wayland or -DWS=NullWS for developer boards.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cross-compilation</h3>

<p>CMake uses toolchain files for cross-compiling. These are usually not necessary when you are targeting the machine you are building on (native or host compilation).</p>

<p>For cross-compiling, we are already providing a number of different CMake toolchain files for a number of different architectures on Linux (armv7,armv7hf,armv8,x86_32,x86_64, mips32, mips64), QNX(aarch64le, armle-v7, x86_32, x86_64) and iOS. You can find these in <span class="code">[path-to-sdk]/cmake/toolchains</span>, and you can also use these as guidance to make a different build setup. Toolchains are of course passed directly to the cmake command line: <span class="code">cmake ../.. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=[path-to-sdk]/cmake/toolchains/Linux-gcc-armv8</span></p>

<h2 id="ANDROID_INSTRUCTIONS">Android instructions</h2>

<h3>Setup</h3>

Download the <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html">Android SDK</a> , NDK and configure it with the Android Platforms you require (the examples currently use Android 26 but can easily be changed). We recommend using Android Studio, but the command line tools work as well.
<ul>
<li>If using Android Studio
	<ul>
		<li>Use the dialog: <span class="code">Import project</span>, and import the <span class="code">build-android</span> folder you wish to build</li>
		<li>Go to Tools>Android>SDK Manager and download the NDK, CMake, LLDB, Android platform 26, Android build tools</li>
		<li>In general, follow the IDE's prompts to download and configure any additional packages required.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>If using the command line tools
	<ul>
		<li> Use the Android SDK Manager and download the NDK, CMake, LLDB, Android platform 26, Android build tools</li>
		<li>Navigate to the <span class="code">build-android</span> folder either in the root of the SDK, or in the folder of the Example you wish to build.</li>
		<li>Create a local.properties file variable and add the line <span class="code">sdk-dir=[path-to-the-ANDROID-sdk]</span>, or add an environment variable <span class="code">ANDROID_HOME=[path-to-the-ANDROID-sdk]</span></li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gradle basics</h3>

<p>Android uses its own build system, which uses CMake internally: you do not call CMake at all, you run Gradle or the Gradle Wrapper and it will call CMake when necessary.</p>

<p>Each example has a <span class="code">build-android</span> folder which contains the necessary Gradle project files for that example only, and a <span class="code">build-android</span> folder in the root of the SDK for building the entire SDK. The <span class="code">build-android</span>.</p>

<p>The easiest way to build, run and debug with gradle is to download and use Android Studio from Google. This is highly recommended, if nothing else for the easy on-device debugging that it offers.</p>

<ul><li>Use Google's documentation for general instructions on using Android Studio. The UI is intuitive and we do not require special steps. Additionally, android studio may prompt you to download and install various packages, update several aspects of the examples (such as when newer versions of plugins are available) etc., you may do that if you wish.</li></ul>

<p>Otherwise, building from the command line is also very easy. We are using the <span class="code">gradle wrapper</span> to avoid the need to download and install <span class="code">gradle</span>. The wrapper is a tiny script located in the corresponding <span class="code">build-android</span> folder. This means you do not need to install gradle. The wrapper will automatically download (if not present) the required gradle version and run it. Using the gradle wrapper is optional, if you prefer you can download, install and use Gradle.</p>
<p>To use the gradle wrapper:</p>

<ul><li>Run <span class="code">gradlew assemble[Debug/Release] [parameters]</span> from the build android folder</li></ul>

To use gradle:
<ul>
<li>Download, install and add to the path <span class="code">gradle</span></li>
<li>Run <span class="code">gradle assemble[Debug/Release] [parameters]</span> from the build-android folder</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gradle properties</h3>

<p>There are a few different properties that can/need to be configured. These can be set up in different places:</p>

<ul>
<li>A <span class="code">gradle.properties</span> file in each example or framework module configures properties for that project.</li>
<li>Additionally, a global <span class="code">gradle.properties</span> file in the GRADLE_USER_HOME directory. We do not provide that, but it is very convenient to globally override all the SDK options, for example for key signing or for changing the target android ABI for the whole SDK</li>
<li>Finally, you can pass those properties as command-line parameters, by passing -P[PARAM_NAME]=[PARAM_VALUE] in the command line.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Android ABIs</h4>

<p>By default, each example's <span class="code">gradle.properties</span> file has an <span class="code">ANDROID_ABIS=x86,x86_64,armeabi-v7a,arm64-v8a</span> entry. This creates an apk that targets those architectures.</p>

<p>To build for more or less architectures than (for example, when developing you would probably only build for your platform's architecture, to decrease build times), either change the properties in each project you want, or add a corresponding line to the global <span class="code">gradle.properties</span> file (this overrides per-project properties), or build with, for example, <span class="code">gradlew assembleDebug -PANDROID_ABIS=armeabi-v7a</span> (this overrides both <span class="code">gradle.properties</span> files).</p>

<h4>APK Signing</h4>

<p>Our gradle scripts have provision for signing the release apks. In order to do that, all you need to do is set up some properties in your apks. We recommend that if you set up your own keystore, add your usernames and key aliases to a global <span class="code">gradle.properties</span>, and pass the passwords through the command line. In any case, the following properties must be set either per project (in per-project gradle.properties) or globally (in systemwide gradle.properties) or through command line (-PNOSIGN):</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="code">KEYSTORE=[Path-to-keystore-file]</span></li>
<li><span class="code">KEYSTORE_PASSWORD=[Password-to-keystore]</span></li>
<li><span class="code">KEY_ALIAS=[Alias-to-signing-key]</span></li>
<li><span class="code">KEY_PASSWORD=[Password-to-signing]</span></li>
</ul>

<p>If you don't wish to sign your release apks, you must instead pass the parameter NOSIGN(with any value) to disable signing</p>

<ul><li><span class="code">NOSIGN=[anything]</span></li></ul>
