An effect is intended to describe an entire, possibly multipass, rendering configuration, for several different objects &#45; potentially an entire scene &#45; by defining all the targets, textures, buffers, different pipelines for different objects, as long as they fulfil some similar conceptual roles (see subpass groups). By using &quot;SEMANTICS&quot;, i.e. descriptions of different items of information that may be provided from outside (e.g. the model, the animation system, or other), it provides a clear interface for the application to provide this information and render automatically. For an implementation of a rendering system using that, see the RenderManager in Vulkan Utilities. " alt="" coords="195,5,319,32"/>
