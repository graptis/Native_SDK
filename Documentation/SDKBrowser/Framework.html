			<p>For a detailed explanation of how the Framework functions, please refer to the <a href="../Documents/RELEASE/PowerVR Framework.Development Guide.pdf" target="_blank" class="link">PowerVR Framework Development Guide.</a></p>
			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>The PowerVR Framework is a complete framework source code, targeted for all major platforms, such as Windows, Linux, and OS X, as well as Android and iOS mobile platforms. A key strength of the PowerVR Framework is that it is platform-agnostic, meaning that with the same code, it is possible to compile for different platforms without changing source code.</p>
			<p>The majority of the code is written in C++ and tested across different compilers (namely Visual Studio 2013, GNU Compiler Collection and Clang) using modern style and  provides a complete framework for application development. There is also supporting per-platform code (Objective-C code for iOS and OS X, some Java code for Android, etc.), and project files.</p>
			<p>The Framework consists of libraries divided by functionality, as shown in the figure below. These modules are provided to be compiled as static libraries, but you can choose to use them differently, if desired.</p>

			<h3>PVRCore</h3>
			<h4><strong><a href="../../Framework/PVRCore/Documentation/Index.html" target="_blank">View source code documentation</a></strong></h4>
			<p>This is the supporting code of the library to leverage for your own use. PVRCore is also used by the rest of the Framework and because of that, all examples using any other part of the Framework should link with PVRCore.</p>
			<h3>PVRAssets</h3>
			<h4><strong><a href="../../Framework/PVRAssets/Documentation/Index.html" target="_blank">View source code documentation</a></strong></h4>
			<p>This is the Frameworkâ€™s asset code. It includes classes and helpers for scene representation, asset loading code, etc. PVRAssets supports the loading of POD files, PVR and PFX materials format, as well as limited support for a number of texture formats.</p>
			<h3>PVRShell</h3>
			<h4><strong><a href="../../Framework/PVRShell/Documentation/Index.html" target="_blank">View source code documentation</a></strong></h4>
			<p>This is the native system abstraction (event loops, surfaces, windows, etc.) which greatly simplifies cross-platform compatibility. Essentially, PVRShell provides you with useful scaffolding for cross-platform development.</p>
			<h3>PVRVk</h3>
			<h4><strong><a href="../../Framework/PVRVk/Documentation/Index.html" target="_blank">View source code documentation</a></strong></h4>
			<p>This is a Vulkan C++ wrapper sporting reference-counted objects with lifetime management, strongly typed enums and other niceties.</p>
			<h3>PVRUtils</h3>
			<h4><strong><a href="../../Framework/PVRUtils/Documentation/Index.html" target="_blank">View source code documentation</a></strong></h4>
			<p>This is actually two libraries (the OpenGL ES version and the Vulkan version) providing very convenient helpers and wrappers, simplifying common OpenGL and Vulkan tasks such as context creation and texture loading. The Vulkan version is written agains PVRVk. Both also contain each a version of the UIRenderer, a 2D/3D printing library that can be used for text or sprite renderering. Its interface is very similar between OpenGL ES and Vulkan, of course taking into account the core differences of the two APIs.</p>
			<h3>PVRCamera</h3>
			<h4><strong><a href="../../Framework/PVRCamera/Documentation/Index.html" target="_blank">View source code documentation</a></strong></h4>
			<p>This is the code for interfacing with the camera of mobile platforms. A "dummy" desktop version is provided to ease development.</p>

		<div id="Building">
			<h2>Building</h2>
			<p>All PowerVR examples for all platforms will build the PowerVR Framework libraries they require. If you use them, or base your own code on them, you should not need to have to build the Framework separately - just add the relevant project files for your platforms as dependencies. That said, the PowerVR SDK normally also ships with pre-built versions of the libraries in the folder <span class="code">[SDK]/Framework/Bin/[Platform]</span>, where <span class="code">[SDK]</span> is the SDK root and <span class="code">[Platform]</span> is the name of your platform of interest - this is where you would normally link.</p>
			<p>All modules can be built separately, by navigating to <span class="code">[SDK]/Framework/[ModuleName]/Build/[Platform]</span>, where <span class="code">[ModuleName]</span> is the name of the specific module of the PowerVR Framework. You can then run a build command as normal for that platform, although this is not required, as building the examples automatically builds the Framework.</span>
		</div>
		
		<div id="CreatingAnApplication">
		<h2>Creating an Application</h2>
		<p>To create a typical application, please follow these steps:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Firstly, either build the Framework components previously mentioned (by moving to the corresponding <span class="code">/Builds/[Platform]</span> or add their build projects/scripts to your own as dependencies.</li>
			&nbsp;
			<li>Create a project/build script (Visual Studio, Makefile, etc.) for your platform. We suggest taking one of the scripts from the following location as base:</li>
				<p><span class="code">Examples/[Intermediate/Advanced]/[API]/Builds/[Platform]</span>, where <span class="code">[Intermediate/Advanced]</span> is the folder for either the intermediate or advanced example applications supplied with the SDK. In more detail:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Add include directories:</li>
					<ul>
						<li><span class="code">/Framework</span></li>
						<li><span class="code">/Builds/Include</span></li>
					</ul>
					<li>Add library directories:</li>
					<ul>
						<li><span class="code">Framework/Bin/[Platform]</span></li>
						<li>(Optional) <span class="code">/Builds/[Platform]/Lib</span></li>
					</ul>
					<li>Link against static libraries:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>(Optional) <span class="code">PVRUtilsGles/PVRUtilsVk</span></li>
						<li>(If vulkan) <span class="code">PVRVk</span></li>
						<li><span class="code">PVRShell</span></li>
						<li><span class="code">PVRAssets</span></li>
						<li><span class="code">PVRCore</span></li>
					</ul>
				</ul>
			&nbsp;
			<li>Create your application files. For a single CPP file, your includes will usually be:</li>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="code">PVRShell/PVRShell.h</span></li>
				<li><span class="code">PVRUtils/GLES/PVRUtilsGles.h</span> or <span class="code">PVRUtils/Vulkan/PVRUtilsVk.h</span></li>
			</ul>
			&nbsp;
			<li>Write the skeleton of your application (see description of <a href="#PVRShell" class="link">PVRShell</a>)</li>
		</ol>

		<div id="Guidelines">
		<h2>Guidelines and Recommendations</h2>
		<p>Below are a set of guidelines and recommendations you might want to consider when using PowerVR Framework:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Use PVRUtils to simplify common suprisingly complex tasks, making them easy, concise and understandable: Context creation, backbuffer/swapchain setup, texture uploading. Then, simply step through the code to understand the actual mechanics implemented. Especially important for Vulkan tasks that are surprisingly involved, like Texture uploading.</li>
			&nbsp;
			<li>The <span class="code">pvr::assets::Model</span> class contains all the information you need for drawing, including cameras, lights, and effects. Follow a typical PowerVR SDK examples (e.g. IntroducingPVRUtils) to understand its basic use, including getting out of a Model the information about the data layouts of its Meshes, etc.</li>
			&nbsp;
			<li>There are many utility functions that simplify complex tasks between Assets and the underlying API - for example, the pvr::utils::createInputAssemblyFromXXXXXX functions will make sure to populate a Vulkan pipeline's vertex configuration with the correct vertex configuration of a mesh. Similarly, the createXXXXBufferFromXXXX functions will auto-generate and upload VBOs for a mesh. The browse pvr::utils namespace for such helpers</li>
			<li>Make sure you understand the StructuredMemoryView: It is a class that basically allows you to precisely describe a Shader Interface Block (i.e. a UBO/SSBO definition in the shader) and then automatically calculates all its information of every single one of its members (sizes, offsets etc), if needed aligns to dynamic slices and STD140, provides helpers for setting values to mapped memory, and in general makes working with buffers a breeze. All examples that use UBOs or SSBOs use the StructuredMemoryView to define and set values.</li>
		</ul>
