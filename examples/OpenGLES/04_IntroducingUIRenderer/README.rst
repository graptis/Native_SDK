This example introduces the UIRenderer from the PVRUtils library for advanced Text tasks.

Description

The UIRenderer allows the user to create "Sprites" (2D elements) which can be grouped in 2D and/or 3D groups to be displayed as UIs or world text. This includes:

* 2D transformations (pixel and/or NDC coordinates) both single, and in a group
* anchoring on different parts of the screen or the group  
* 3D transformations of groups of sprites

In this example, UIRendererer is used to display images and Unicode text, screen aligned, and with 3D transformations.
