This example introduces the UIRenderer from the PVRUtils library to do advanced Text tasks.

Description
-----------
The UIRenderer allows the user to create "Sprites" (2D elements) which can be grouped in 2D and/or 3D groups to be displayed
as UI's or world text. 2D transformations (pixel and/or NDC coordinates) both single and in a group, anchoring on different 
parts of the screen or the group and 3D transformations of groups of sprites are all possible.
In this example, UIRendererer is used to display images and Unicode text, screen aligned and with 3D transformations.
