Demonstrates dynamic reflection and refraction using a dual paraboloid environment map.

Description
-----------
This example shows a technique to maintain a dynamic environment map by rendering both hemispheres of the scene to two halves of a single rectangular texture. 

This example also demonstrates rendering skyboxes with a full screen quad, reflection, and refraction with chromatic dispersion.

APIs
----
* Vulkan

Controls
--------
- Quit- Close the application
- Left/Right - Change the effect between combinations of reflection and refraction/chromatic dispersion
- Up/Down- Look up or down.
