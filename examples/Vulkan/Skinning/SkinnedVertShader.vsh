/*
	If the current vertex is affected by bones then the vertex position and
	normal will be transformed by the bone matrices. Each vertex wil have up
	to 4 bone indices (inBoneIndex) and bone weights (inBoneWeights).

	The indices are used to index into the array of bone matrices
	(BoneMatrixArray) to get the required bone matrix for transformation. The
	amount of influence a particular bone has on a vertex is determined by the
	weights which should always total 1. So if a vertex is affected by 2 bones
	the vertex position in world space is given by the following equation:

	position = (BoneMatrixArray[Index0] * inVertex) * Weight0 +
	           (BoneMatrixArray[Index1] * inVertex) * Weight1

	The same proceedure is applied to the normals but the translation part of
	the transformation is ignored.

	After this the position is multiplied by the view and projection matrices
	only as the bone matrices already contain the model transform for this
	particular mesh. The two-step transformation is required because lighting
	will not work properly in clip space.
